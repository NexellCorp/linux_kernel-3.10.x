menuconfig MAILBOX
	bool "Mailbox Hardware Support"
	help
	  Mailbox is a framework to control hardware communication between
	  on-chip processors through queued messages and interrupt driven
	  signals. Say Y if your platform supports hardware mailboxes.

if MAILBOX
config ARM_MHU_MBOX
	bool "ARM Message Handling Unit (MHU) Mailbox"
	help
	  This driver provides support for inter-processor communication
	  between System Control Processor (SCP) with Cortex-M3 processor
	  and Application Processors (AP) on some ARM based systems with
	  MHU peripheral.

	  SCP controls most of the power managament on the Application
	  Processors. It offers control and management of: the core/cluster
	  power states, various power domain DVFS including the core/cluster,
	  certain system clocks configuration, thermal sensors and many
	  others.

config ARM_SCPI_PROTOCOL
	bool "ARM System Control and Power Interface (SCPI) Message Protocol"
	select ARM_MHU_MBOX
	help
	  System Control and Power Interface (SCPI) Message Protocol is
	  defined for the purpose of communication between the Application
	  Cores(AP) and the System Control Processor(SCP). The MHU peripheral
	  provides a mechanism for inter-processor communication between SCP
	  and AP.

	  This protocol library provides interface for all the client drivers
	  making use of the features offered by the SCP.

config PL320_MBOX
	bool "ARM PL320 Mailbox"
	depends on ARM_AMBA
	help
	  An implementation of the ARM PL320 Interprocessor Communication
	  Mailbox (IPCM), tailored for the Calxeda Highbank. It is used to
	  send short messages between Highbank's A9 cores and the EnergyCore
	  Management Engine, primarily for cpufreq. Say Y here if you want
	  to use the PL320 IPCM support.
